# Part 3
### Intended Audience
My intended audience should be those who wants to make a contribution to diplomacy policies and communication between countries. The most ideal audience may be those who has the dream of becoming a diplomat and has the passion and enthusiasm to promote world peace and communication between different countries. However, they didn't have enough experience or knowlegde, thus their thoughts are still remain in a naive stage. I want to use my presentation to make them realize that even if the most adorable thing in the world is very weak compared to geopolitical tension and ideological differneces. As a student who is studying public policy, I understand it is a painful process, and actually we may not have a correct answer to solve the problem. But this presentation is still meaningful for those who will step into the learning of public policy, because learning about the cruelty of the world early also means we can start to prepare early. There are sad stories happening everyday, but as dreamers, our mission in life is to find the true "brigde" for communication.
### Adjustments to my final presentation
1. First, I make my story complete by adding necessary description words. I believe those words have at least make my story more smoothly.
2. Second, I design my presentation using shorthand. To better cater to my topic, I choose a dark theme and use the background photos in a sad mood.
3. Third, I redesign some of the figures. I add a blue colour to the panda icon in the map showing which countries have pandas, which can make my audience better find out the exact countries and the number of countries. I also change the alluvial figure into a scatter plot, which should be more accurate to represent the relationship between trade relationship and number of owning pandas.
4. About two hours before my presentation, I get feedback from professor. Unfortunately, I was holding a office hour then. So I only make a few changes to several figures. To avoid "rainbow effect", I change the colour in two figure from categorical colours into just blue and grey, where blue means the countries that overlapped in trade partners and pandas onwing, grey means the rest. I also change another figure which represents the attitude of countries that owning pandas. I use red to represent all the negative attitude and green to represent all the positive attitude. Since my purpose here is just to show that most countries have negative attitude, I think it should be fine now.
5. After the presentation, I realized that my actions to call are vague and not detailed enough. Thus I put more specific actions to call in the end of my story.
### Design decisions
  I learnt quite a lot through the whole process. At the very beginning, I just wanted to make a presentation about pandas. So, I begin to dig topics that can be used. "Panda Dipomacy" comes to my view becasue both Chinese media and western media use the same tone in it. Both sides think it is kind of successful because no one can say no to such a lovely animal. I am really excited to see it, and so I decide to do a presentation based on "panda diplomacy'. <br>
  However, as I do more research and find more related data, I didn't understand why media and even the government thinks it is "successful". That's where my doubts come out. Due to the limit of time, I only expressed three doubts, which may not be enough to say a policy is failing. But at least, the policy is not as successful as the media claims to be. <br>
  I also want to discuss some challenges I faced and how I tried to solve them. The first challeneg is the scarcity of data. Everyone says he or she loves panda, but how I can prove panda is popular? I searched for a lot of reserach, and most research think panda's popularity is a common sense. I spent a lot of time and finally find something, the attendance of Memphis Zoo. After pandas arrived, the attendance increased significantly. It may not be an excellent proof, but I have tried my best. Other data, included in the time China made diplomatic relationships with other countries, and when China gifted pandas. They are all in description words. I can't find a csv file or even a table to show them. So I have to manually create datasets, and manually input the numbers needed. The same thing happends to number of pandas in each country and people's attitude to China. All the above data I visualed in my final presentation is manually enterd.<br>
  I am also grateful to all my friends and professor, who gave my excellent advice on how to make my figures more clear. Professor reminds me the "rainbow effect" can make my readers confused, and my friends helped me find out the most suitable way for visualization. <br>
  All in all, I realized data source and advice from others may be two most important things. Without convincing data, we can't put our ideas into excellent story, and without advice from readers, it will be difficult for us to find potential problems.
