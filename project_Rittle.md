# Part 1
# Outline for project
I want to tell a story about pandas. Pandas are not only cute, but also widely adored by people all over the world. In fact, as a symbol of China, pandas are widely used in diplomacy policy as a bridge to communicate with other countries. "Panda diplomacy" describes this situation. In today's world, there are constant disputes among people and countries, and it is difficult to get an answer to many ideological differences in a short period of time. But at least, on pandas, the attitudes of people all over the world are highly consistent. People like his cute naivety, and also like his peace and friendliness. So, by telling the story of the panda, I want to make people stop and think about what can become a way of communication between different nations. Pandas have given us an excellent answer. <br>
<br>
Story Structure<br>
Setup: Pandas are widely adored by people from all over the world. Under proper protection, their population is rising over the past 50 years.<br>
Conflict: In today's world, differences between nations and nations are widespread and difficult to reconcile.<br>
Resolution: "Panda Diplomacy" can be an excellent example for reference. For people from different countries, there must be some common love shared by people. We can use this as a breakthrough to build a brigde for communication.

# Data Source
1. [Data of how people love and accept pandas](https://go-gale-com.cmu.idm.oclc.org/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA126612060&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=08963703&p=AONE&sw=w&enforceAuth=true&linkSource=delayedAuthFullText&userGroupName=cmu_main&u=cmu_main). Here I use a data from University of Memphis in 2004 done by Jeff Wallace and Andrea Orchik. They include an "Impact of Giant Pandas on Memphis Zoo Attendance" which shows an siginificant increase in 2002 when giant pandas come. <br>
2. [Data on when China establish diplomatic relations with other countries](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/ziliao_674904/2193_674977/200812/t20081221_9284708.shtml) Here is a list of the time China establish relationship with other countries. I want to use this list to compare with a list of the time China giving or renting pandas to other countries. [Pandas outside China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_pandas_around_the_world) Unfortunately, I couldn't find more detailed information of this, I may need to type it into a list which can be used.<br>
3. [Data on World's attitude to China](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/12/05/attitudes-toward-china-2019/) This data shows how people from all over the world view China in 2019. Due to geopolitics, it is clear that most countries don't like China.
