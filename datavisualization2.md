# Data visualization for government debt acrosss differnet countries from 1995 to 2021
I added labels for x axis and y axis, which I believed will help readers understand what the graph trying to show them. Also, I put the values of data points on the curves, because I find it very difficult to compare values between different lines. As a result, if our readers have the values, they can easily compare any other two countries' states.
