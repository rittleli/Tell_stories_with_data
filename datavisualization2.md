# Data visualization for government debt in 2018
I highlight the average debt among all the countries to help readers better find out the state of their own country's debt state.

# Line Chart for government debt acrosss differnet countries from 1995 to 2021
I added labels for x axis and y axis, which I believed will help readers understand what the graph trying to show them. Also, I put the values of data points on the curves, because I find it very difficult to compare change of values between different lines. As a result, if our readers have the values, they can easily compare any other two countries' states.

# Area Chart for government debt across different countries from 1995 to 2021
I am using area chart here. You can see I am using red as the colour for the area, that's because people usually see "red" as an attention or an alert. Debt is obviously something that needs people to feel alert about. I am hopeing the red will give people a sense of crisis, and pay more attention to them. I do want to use a sequnetial colour to show the different amounts of debt where a lighter red meaning a larger debt. However, I can't figure out how to do it in Flourish. 
I also use a larger size dot in the latest year to make my readers pay more attention to the recent situations. 
I add labels of x axis and y axis to make readers better understand what the graph is showing. I also put title and source since they are necessary to my visualization.

# Compare between different visulizations
The column chart (the first visuliazation) gives us a clear comparision between different countries. However, it can only show one year's data. It is likely that some countries may have accidently high debt in one year, and return to normal state afterwards. As a result, the column chart may not fully represent the debt situations of a country.
The line chart (the second visuliazation) shows us the change of debts from year to year for each country. The slope is very clear, and can perfectly show us a trend of each country's debt situation. So, we may able to predict what the countries' debt situation may be based on the trend. However, as I mentioned above, it is difficult for people to compare between different lines. We can know a country increases debt fast, but we are not sure if this country has more debt than another country.
The area chart( the third visuliazation) helps fix this problem, and that's why I choose this chart. The area is obvious, we can easily easily compare area sizes, and get a conclusion of which country may have the largest debt. But we may not be able to find the trend of a single country.
So, the audience for the second chart may be leaders of a single country. He wants to find out the trend of his country's debt situation. If the trend is terrible, he may need to compare with other countries' trends and find out what may be the reason: a global crisis or just his own country's crisis.
The audience for the third chart may be the ones come from an international organization. They wants to find out which country has the worst debt situation. And they may provide some help with those undeveloped countries with terrible debt situation.
