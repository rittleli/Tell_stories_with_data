# Why this figure is confusing
1. Its X axis is very weird, which is a repeated pattern of year 2010 and 2020. Most readers will not think that way, and thus it may take readers a few time before they come to realize what it is trying to say.<br>
2. It has a confusing range of color for each new power generation technologies, later I realized it is the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile. While 5th percentile and 95th percentile may be important in statistics, it is useless here. The whole report didn't use 5th percentile and 95th percentile, it only focuses on mean. <br>
3. It is also confusing by adding another range of fossil fuel cost range, which overlapped with much of the areas of each new energy. <br>
