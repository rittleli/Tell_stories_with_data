# Why this figure is confusing
1. Its X axis is very weird, which is a repeated pattern of year 2010 and 2020. Most readers will not think that way, and thus it may take readers a few time before they come to realize what it is trying to say.<br>
2. It has a confusing range of color for each new power generation technologies, later I realized it is the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile. While 5th percentile and 95th percentile may be important in statistics, it is useless here. The whole report didn't use 5th percentile and 95th percentile, it only focuses on mean. <br>
3. It is also confusing by adding another range of fossil fuel cost range, which overlapped with much of the areas of each new energy. <br>
# sketch out a solution and feedback from others

In this sketch, I tried to use two colours to represent the two years, and use different energies as X-axis. I also try to use a more straightforward title. Since I believe my audience should be those who are interested in investing new energy power plants, I directly put the title as the two energy whose cost dropped most significantly. I also use a sequence from the largest drop of cost to the smallest drop( or even increase). I choose the two colours randomly, I am not sure which colour pattern should be the best.<br>
<br>
Below is feedback from my three friends and feedback from in-class group discussion.<br>
Student A(from energy enigneering and public policy program) "It is a clear data visualization over all. I can understand what you are showing. It is simple but clear. But I believe it will be better if you can put labels on each coloumn. It will be perfect if you can add a percent of change. Maybe you can also try to add a broken line to show the change. Well, forget about the last recommendation, it will make it worse." <br>
<br>
Student B(from INI) "It makes me confused that the title only covers two power but the X axis covers too many energies. Just look at the title, I will expect that the X axis should be a list of years. That's why I spend a little time figuring what it is talking about. Other things are fine. By the way, I love the colors, it is pretty!" <br>
<br>
Group from class "It is beautiful and it clearly conveys the necessary information. It is a little confusing of the unit of the Y-axis, does it in dollar or cents? "Adding a label will definitely make the figure more clear." "Maybe you can try to use an overlapped between the two years to show the change part. Or, but there are also some energies have the cost increase, then overlapping may be a little confusing."<br>

In this sketch, I tried to put all the 2010 data points on the left, and all the 2020 data points on the right. By dividing the two years, I hope it can help readers better compare between different energies. I choose to use grey as the colour, because here I don't want to make a conclusion for readers, I am expecting they will get their own conlcusion by comparing different energies.<br>
Below is feedback from my three friends and feedback from in-class group discussion.<br>
Student A(from energy enigneering and public policy program) "This figure is a litte more confusing than the former one. I will suggust that you can add the change in percent or quantity in the right column. It is really difficult to compare between the left and the right, if they have similar length." <br>
Student B(from INI) "Compared to the former figure, I spend more time figuring out what this one is trying to say. It is also more ugly. The left column has a clear sequence from the highest cost to the lowest cost, but the right part is really confusing. I didn't get what you are tring to represent. Maybe it is because there is no clear comparision between the two years, so I can't understand the specfic quantile of the changes." <br>
